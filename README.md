# Earlybird Jobs Browser Extension
This extension allows LinkedIn users to sort and filter jobs from their personalized LinkedIn 
recommended feed. You can install the extension from the Chrome webstore [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/earlybird-jobs-find-and-a/dhogfpnpeafodclcnigbfedmcnmahefc?authuser=1&hl=en). If you'd like to build and load the extension
to your browser yourself, you can follow the steps below.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.
